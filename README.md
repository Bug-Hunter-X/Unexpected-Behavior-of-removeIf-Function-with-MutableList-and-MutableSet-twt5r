This repository demonstrates an uncommon, subtle bug related to the `removeIf` function in Kotlin when used with `MutableList` and `MutableSet`.  The core issue stems from the differing behavior of `removeIf` on these collection types and a misunderstanding of how the `removeIf` operation modifies the underlying collection in place. The example code highlights this difference in behavior and a solution to address potential unexpected results.  Solutions show how to prevent this issue.
